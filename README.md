# usdUtils

Welcome to usdUtils, a repository for experimenting with USD (Universal Scene Description) related tools. This repository is dedicated to developing tools for importing, converting, and manipulating assets within the context of USD workflows.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to explore and develop utilities that streamline the process of working with USD files and assets. This includes:

- Importing assets from various formats into USD.
- Converting existing assets to USD format.
- Building tools for organizing and managing USD projects.
- Implementing workflows for efficient collaboration and version control with USD files.

## Folder Structure

To maintain consistency and organization within USD projects, this repository follows a recommended folder structure for organizing assets, shots, sequences, configurations, and outputs. The folder structure used in this repository is as follows:

```markdown
`Project_Root
├── assets
│   ├── type
│   │   ├── asset1
│   │   │   ├── lkdev
│   │   │   │   ├── scene_files
│   │   │   │   └── _publish
│   │   │   ├── model
│   │   │   │   ├── scene_files
│   │   │   │   └── _publish
│   │   │   ├── tex
│   │   │   │   ├── scene_files
│   │   │   │   └── _publish
│   │   │   └── _publish
│   │   └── asset2
│   │       ├── lkdev
│   │       │   ├── scene_files
│   │       │   └── _publish
│   │       ├── model
│   │       │   ├── scene_files
│   │       │   └── _publish
│   │       ├── tex
│   │       │   ├── scene_files
│   │       │   └── _publish
│   │       └── _publish
└── shots
``


This structure provides a clear organization for managing assets, shots, sequences, configurations, and outputs within a USD project.
